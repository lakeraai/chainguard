# Reporting Security Issues

The Lakera team takes security issues in Lakera projects seriously.

We appreciate your efforts to follow responsible disclosure projects and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Please use the project's [GitHub Security tab](https://github.com/lakeraai/lcguard/security/) or email `security` at `lakera.ai` to report any vulnerabilities.

If you have any questions or concerns, please email `security` at `lakera.ai`.

After your initial report, the team will do its best to keep you updated as our team works towards a fix and an announcement. We may ask for more information or guidance from you.
